# Raygun4Apple

[Raygun](https://raygun.com/) provider for iOS, tvOS & macOS supporting Crash Reporting and Real User Monitoring.

Officially Supports:

- iOS 12+
- tvOS 12+
- macOS 12+

Note: raygun4apple may work with earlier OS versions, however we recommend updating to the versions we build and test for to avoid experiencing any unexpected issues.

## Installation

### Using the Swift Package Manager

#### From Xcode

1. Choose `File > Add Package Dependenciesâ€¦`
2. In the Search field on the top right, enter the Github URL for raygun4apple: `https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4apple.git`
3. Click "Add Package", then choose your project under the "Add to Target" section. Click "Add Package" again.

You're now ready to [configure the client](#using-raygun).

#### OR: Manually

If you're not using Xcode to manage your packages, you can instead update your Package.swift file to include raygun4apple as a dependency.

Here is an example of a macOS CLI application which uses raygun4apple as a dependency:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "macos-cli",
    dependencies: [
        //Note - the version must be atleast 2.0.0 as this is earliest release of this package through SPM.
        .package(url: "https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4apple.git", from: "2.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "macos-cli",
            dependencies: ["raygun4apple"])
    ]
)
```

### With CocoaPods

To integrate Raygun using CocoaPods, update your Podfile to include:

```bash
pod 'raygun4apple'
```

Once updated, you can run `pod install` from Terminal.

### With GitHub releases

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4apple/releases). The frameworks are attached to each release as a zipped file. This can be downloaded, unzipped and included in you project directory.

Once included, go to your app's target **General** settings and add the raygun4apple framework to the **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section. Ensure that the framework is set to **Embed & Sign**.

## Using Raygun

### Swift

To use Raygun, import the package in your Swift file. Here is an example which imports raygun4apple, initializes the provider, and sends a test exception. Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your API key from your Application Settings screen in Raygun.

```swift
import raygun4apple

let raygunClient = RaygunClient.sharedInstance(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
raygunClient.enableCrashReporting()
raygunClient.send(exception: NSException.init(name: .genericException, reason: "This is an exception from Raygun4Apple!"))
```

NB: If you recieve a `A server with the specified hostname could not be found` error, you may need to [enable outbound connections for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_network_client). Choose your project target in the left-hand navigator, then choose the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, and check the `Outgoing Connections (Client)` in the "App Sandbox" section.

#### Swift UI

_You might like to check our our [Swift UI example app](https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/Raygun4SwiftUI-ExampleApp)_

You likely want to start Raygun in your `AppDelegate`. By default newer Swift UI apps do not come with an `AppDelegate`, so you can [follow these instructions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-add-an-appdelegate-to-a-swiftui-app) to add one to your project (for macOS you need to [use NSApplication](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71291654/swiftui-appdelegate-on-macos) instead)

Once you've done that, your `AppDelegate.swift` should look something like this:

```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit
import raygun4apple


class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {

      let raygunClient = RaygunClient.sharedInstance(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
      raygunClient.enableCrashReporting()

      return true
    }
}
```

You are now tracking crashes across your application, and can report manually using the `RaygunClient.sharedInstance()`, for example:

```swift
RaygunClient.sharedInstance().send(exception: NSException.init(name: .genericException, reason: "This is an exception from Raygun4Apple!"))
```

#### Identifying customers

By default, each user will be identified as an anonymous user/customers. However you can set more detailed customer information with the following snippet.

```swift
RaygunClient.sharedInstance().userInformation = RaygunUserInformation.init(
    identifier: "123",
    email:      "ronald@raygun.com",
    fullName:   "Ronald Raygun",
    firstName:  "Ronald",
    anonymous:  false,
    uuid:       UUID().uuidString
)
```

(More initializers are provided on `RaygunUserInformation` should you want to omit some parts of this information)

Now your crashes will be tracked as affecting this user in Raygun Crash Reporting:

### Objective-C

In your AppDelegate class file, import the header for your target platform.

```objective-c
#import <raygun4apple/raygun4apple_iOS.h>
```

Initialize the Raygun client by adding the following snippet to your AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method:

```objective-c
[RaygunClient sharedInstanceWithApiKey:@"_INSERT_API_KEY_"];
[RaygunClient.sharedInstance enableCrashReporting];
[RaygunClient.sharedInstance enableRealUserMonitoring];
[RaygunClient.sharedInstance enableNetworkPerformanceMonitoring]; // Optional
```

## Sending a test error event

To ensure that the Raygun client is correctly configured, try sending a test crash report with the following snippet.

```objective-c
[RaygunClient.sharedInstance sendException:@"Raygun has been successfully integrated!"
                                withReason:@"A test crash report from Raygun"
                                  withTags:@[@"Test"]
                            withCustomData:@{@"TestMessage":@"Hello World!"}];
```

## Set up Customers

By default, each user will be identified as an anonymous user/customers. However you can set more detailed customer information with the following snippet.

```objective-c
RaygunUserInformation *userInfo = nil;
userInfo = [[RaygunUserInformation alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"ronald@raygun.com"
                                                   withEmail:@"ronald@raygun.com"
                                                withFullName:@"Ronald Raygun"
                                               withFirstName:@"Ronald"];
RaygunClient.sharedInstance.userInformation = userInfo;
```
